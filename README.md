# AD9851-DDS
DDS signal source variable by 1 Hz to 70 MHz. 
Hacked and mangled from several online public projects to make it work with standard backpack 2x16 i2c display and rotary encoder without unimproved rotary.h files. Works, but it isn't pretty. Not a coder, but rather a ham handed tinkerer.
